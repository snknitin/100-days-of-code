# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tried out the Burst balloons problem and Trimming a BST

**Thoughts:**  Used DP solution for the first one and a recursive solution to trim a bst into a range of node values

### Day 1: July 20, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tried out the Math related problems
* Ugly number 
* Max points on a Line
* Self Crossing path -  if you go North, West, East, South based on numbers in an array

**Thoughts:**  
* Ugly number is one which has only 2,3,5 as it's prime factors
* Took into account repeated data points, horizontal slopes and parallel lines and single data points
* Two cases, one with just the 4 directions and one with 6 for the next set of north and west to intersect. Done with geometric requirements of distances to cross a path

### Day 2: July 22, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tried out the following problems
* Max binary tree
* Removing duplicates from linked list

**Thoughts:**  Used recursion for both
